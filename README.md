# ajaxforum
Prototype AJAX message board written in PHP 5

### OLD CODE WARNING! :)

This was an unfinished forum project started with a friend of mine in 2006.  It sought to implement AJAX functionality into a traditional message board layout.  This forum implemented a MySQL database backend, and used a hybrid object-oriented/procedural program structure.  Posting of messages and viewing of threads were partially implemented.
